            <h2>Welcome to Starbox!</h2>
			<p>Starbox is a simple file sharing program that allows you to search all the files that you have access to (yours and your friends'). This page shows you how to interact with the program. You can navigate by clicking on the four buttons in the upper right corner.</p>
			<p>Starbox keeps track of available files using what are called index files. At a constant time interval your index file is updated to reflect the files of your system, similarly, index files are downloaded from your friends at a constant time interval. If you've just added a friend or have made changes to your file system you might want to press the "Update index" button in the options.</p>
			</br>
			<ul>
				<li> - Click the search glass if you want to search amongst the files you have access to.</li>
				<li> - Click on the person to handle your friends and to add new friends.</li>
				<li> - By clicking the cog wheel you can change your personal settings, update your index and retrieve the index from your friends.</li>
				<li> - The question mark shows this help page.</li>
